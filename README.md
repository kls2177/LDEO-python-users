# LDEO-python-users

This is a repository of python code for the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) community (or anyone else). We are an academic community of Earth scientists. We hope that learning by sharing code will help us all become better python users.

Please feel free to contribute to this repository. As we are all learning, please be sure to include comments within your code. 

Thanks!
